I’m Vugar Mirza—an engineer-in-training who loves blending creativity,
structure, and community-building. My journey into computing started with
curiosity about how interactive experiences are crafted. Today I focus on
modern web technologies, inclusive design, and teaching others what I learn.

## Background

- **Education:** B.Sc. in Information Systems (expected 2026), Azerbaijan State University of Economics  
- **Focus areas:** Human-centered design, full-stack development, and data-informed decision making  
- **Methodologies:** Agile delivery, design sprints, and rapid prototyping

Over the last year I have collaborated on student-led products, delivered
technical workshops for first-time coders, and contributed UX research that
shaped curriculum planning tools. I enjoy taking vague ideas and building
clarity through wireframes, experiments, and crisp documentation.

## Activities & Impact

- **Course Projects:** Led the planning and execution of Project 1 (Smart
  Planner), coordinating user interviews, roadmap definition, and demo-ready
  prototypes.
- **Hour of Code Mentor:** Designed lesson plans and coached 60+ middle school
  students, emphasizing growth mindsets and creative problem-solving.
- **Community & Clubs:** Serve as communications lead for the campus Tech
  Collective, organizing meetups, sponsorships, and talks by alumni.

## What’s next

I’m actively looking for internships and project partnerships where I can
drive UI implementation, integrate APIs, and continue championing accessible,
inclusive tech. If you’re working on something meaningful, let’s connect via
