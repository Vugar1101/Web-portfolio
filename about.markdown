I’m Vugar Mirza—an engineer-in-training who loves blending creativity,
structure, and community-building. My journey into computing started with
curiosity about how interactive experiences are crafted. Today I focus on
modern web technologies, inclusive design, and teaching others what I learn.

## Background

- **Education:** B.Sc. in Computer Science, ADA university  
- **Focus areas:** Cybersecurity, Network, and ethical hacking  

Over the past year, I have actively engaged in student-led projects, cybersecurity training programs, and volunteer initiatives, contributing to both technical and social-impact work. I have delivered workshops and mentoring support for students, collaborated in team-based projects such as Benjamin Buttons, and strengthened my skills through hands-on coursework in programming, networks, and data engineering. I enjoy turning abstract ideas into structured solutions through experimentation, documentation, and practical implementation.

## Activities & Impact

- **Course Projects:** Led the planning and execution of Project 1, coordinating team members.
- **Hour of Code Mentor:** Designed lesson plans and coached 17 middle school
  students, emphasizing growth mindsets and creative problem-solving.
- **Community & Clubs:** Serve as communications lead for the campus Tech
  Collective, organizing meetups, sponsorships, and talks by alumni.

## What’s next

I’m actively looking for internships and project partnerships where I can
drive penetration tests, and continue championing accessible,
inclusive tech. If you’re working on something meaningful, let’s connect via
