Below is a curated selection of work that reflects how I approach design,
development, and delivery. Each project includes links, screenshots, and
stories about what I learned.

## Project 1 · How does hardware work?

- **Role:** Team lead  
- **Stack:** Logic gates  
- **Highlights:**
  - Built dynamic sprint planner that converts course requirements into weekly
    action items.
  - Implemented drag-and-drop prioritization and progress heatmaps to give
    students a quick read on workload.
  - Delivered accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, color-safe palette)
    after user testing with color-blind participants.

**Outcome:** Reduced planning time for beta testers by 40% and informed a new
academic advising flow for our department.

- **Role:** Curriculum designer & facilitator  
- **Stack:** MakeCode, micro:bit, Scratch  
- **Highlights:**
  - Created a storytelling exercise where students program branching narratives.
  - Authored printable guides and Loom walkthroughs so teachers can run the
    session independently.

**Outcome:** Introduced 60+ middle-school students to code; 87% reported higher
confidence writing programs afterward.

- **Role:** Frontend engineer and documentation lead  
- **Stack:** Next.js, Storybook, Sass  
- **Highlights:**
  - Designed token-based theming that lets partner clubs customize colors with
    three CSS variables.
  - Automated visual regression tests with Chromatic to keep the library stable.
  - Authored usage guidelines so non-technical club members can assemble
    pages without touching code.

**Outcome:** Platform now powers five organization sites and cut their launch
time from weeks to days.
